## Listing block devices
```bash
lsblk
```
Knowledge check
1. What type of device would /dev/sdx commonly be?
1. What type of device would /dev/vdx commonly be?
1. Where does lsblk get its information from?

:::details Answers
1. SCSI, SATA, and disks connected via USB
1. KVM virtual machines
1. The kernel partition table: /proc/partitions

## Creating partitions
```bash
fdisk {device}
```

## Creating and mounting filesystems
Creating filesystems
```bash
mkfs.xfs /dev/device
mkfs.ext4 /dev/device
mkfs.vfat /dev/device
```
Mounting devices
```bash
mount /dev/device /mnt/path # mount a device
umount /mnt/path # unmount a device
```

Finding mounts
```bash
mount # shows all mounted filesystems, including kernel mounts
findmnt # shows all mounts in tree-like structure
lsblk
```

Knowledge Check
- Which filesystem offers multi-OS support?
- Which filesystem is used for a UEFI boot partition?
- Which filesystem is the default for RHEL?

1. vfat

1. XFS

## Mounting partitions automatically
To mount a filesystem automatically, add entry to /etc/fstab.
- Always create a backup before editing
- Always verify correctness before rebooting (`mount -a` or `findmnt --verify`)
```text
device mount-path filesystem defaults 0 0
```
The last two entries are legacy options. Rarely used on modern systems.

Super useful troubleshooting tip: If the fstab is broken (or something else),
you may not be able to access a console if there is no root password. In this
case, edit the GRUB boot command by pressing `e` at the boot menu. Remove `rhgb
quiet` from the end of the line starting with `linux` and add `init=/bin/bash`.
The filesystem will be mounted in read-only mode. Use `mount -o remount,rw /`
and make the necessary changes. After making file changes, use `sync` to ensure
there are no changes pending in cache before reboot.

## Using UUID and labels
Block device names (eg /dev/sdb) are subject to change.

Knowledge Check
1. What command can be used to determine UUIDs?
1. What command can be used to set a label for an ext filesystem?
1. What command can be used to set a label for an XFS filesystem?
1. How can you set a label while creating a filesystem?

:::details Answers
1. `blkid`
1. `tune2fs -L`
1. `xfs_admin -L`
1. `mkfs.* -L`

## Systemd mounts

Example systemd mount: /etc/systemd/system/files.mount
```text
[Unit]
Documentation=man:fstab(5) man:systemd-fstab-generator(8)

[Mount]
What=/dev/disk/by-uuid/{UUID}
Where=/mnt/path
Type=ext4
Options=nofail

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Note: Examples copied from /run/systemd/generator will be missing the Install
section.

Knowledge Check
1. How can you view the systemd mounts?

:::details Answers
1. Cat the files in /run/systemd/generator

## Creating a swap partition

Create swap space from block device
- Set partition type to linux-swap
- Use `mkswap` to create the swap filesystem
- Activate using `swapon`


## Lab Exercise
- Create a partition with a size of 1GiB. Format it with ext4, and mount it
persistently on /mounts/files using its UUID
- Create a 512 MiB swap partition and mount it persistently
